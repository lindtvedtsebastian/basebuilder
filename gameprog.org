** Discussion around the development process

*** Thoughts on the Unity

Ideas:
- Collaboration is hard because shit breaks all the time
- Prototyping is easy and fast

*** Process and communication

- We used GitHub and Discord, meetings on fridays.

*** Version control and issue tracking

- We used GitHub. (Better than GitLab? Still hard to coordinate issues and current work)

For development we used a branch and merge approach, where we branched
from main for every new feature or bugfix we wanted to implement, and
then merge that branch into main again when we were done. We did this
using pull requests in GitHub, which ties into issue management, as
GitHub allows for automation of moving or closing issues based on this.

** Individual discussions

In this section we will each reflect on our personal thoughts around
the development process, and how we experienced it.
