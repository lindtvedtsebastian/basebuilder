# Set the binary macro attribute for binary files
#
# binary is short for unsetting the text, diff and merge attributes.
#
# text: Unsetting the text attribute on a path tells Git not to attempt any end-of-line conversion upon checkin or checkout.
# diff: A path to which the diff attribute is unset will generate Binary files differ (or a binary patch, if binary patches are enabled).
# merge: Take the version from the current branch as the tentative merge result, and declare that the merge has conflicts. This is suitable for binary files that do not have a well-defined merge semantics.
#
# Merging Unity's yaml files is not straight forward and should not be attempted manually,
# or by conventional text merge strategies.
#
# Smart merge can be used via UnityYAMLMerge tool included with Unity, but this requires manual setup.
# See: https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/SmartMerge.html
